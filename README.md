Analysis of Communication Survey
========================================================
  
The "refugee communication survey" has been developped by UNHCR Jordan. The goals were:
- Establish a baseline to measure future achievements of our communication strategy
- Establish coordination opportunities
- Define priorities in terms of needs and interventions.

The survey has three major parts
 1. Communication needs: Establish main topics where thereâ€™s a lack of information (document, assistance, legal support, etc.) and the possible reasons for the gaps

 2. Communication channels: Define  used channel (mobile, tv, radio, net, social networks, leaflet..) , how often they are used and how far they are trusted
 
 3. Feedback mechanism: Assess existing feedback system and how they can be improved
 
 This analysis is organised through 4 scripts
 
  1-clean.R : merge the data that were obtained from tow data collection systems (LimeSurvey for phone interview & opendataKit for mobiel data collection within the camp)
  
  2-analysis.R : reshape all the data and create the various data frame used for the plots in the report and in the presentation
  
  3-report.R : generate the report (narrative + graphs)
  
  4-slides.R : generate slides (narrative + graphs)
