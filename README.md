Analysis of Communication Survey
========================================================
  
  The "refugee communication survey" has been developped by UNHCR Jordan. The goals were:
  - Establish a baseline to measure future achievements of our communication strategy
- Establish coordination opportunities
- Define priorities in terms of needs and interventions.

The survey has three major parts
 1. Communication needs: Establish main topics where thereâ€™s a lack of information (document, assistance, legal support, etc.) and the possible reasons for the gaps

 2. Communication channels: Define  used channel (mobile, tv, radio, net, social networks, leaflet..) , how often they are used and how far they are trusted
 
 3. Feedback mechanism: Assess existing feedback system and how they can be improved
